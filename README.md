# Genomic-Text-Curation-Topic-Grouping-
This project performs simple genomic entity extraction and topic clustering on a collection of scientific abstracts related to Alzheimer’s disease. The goal is to curate key biological information—such as variants, genes, and associated phenotypes—and to group the publications into meaningful thematic clusters using NLP techniques.
