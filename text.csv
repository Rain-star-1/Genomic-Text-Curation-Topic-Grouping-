T1,Translating Alzheimer's disease-associated polymorphisms into functional candidates: a survey of IGAP genes and SNPs,"The International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) is a consortium for characterizing the genetic landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The identified and/or confirmed 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD are located on non-coding DNA regions, and their functional impacts on AD are as yet poorly understood. We evaluated the roles of the IGAP SNPs by integrating data from many resources, based on whether the IGAP SNP was (1) a proxy for a coding SNP or (2) associated with altered mRNA transcript levels. For (1), we confirmed that 12 AD-associated coding common SNPs and five nonsynonymous rare variants are in linkage disequilibrium with the IGAP SNPs. For (2), the IGAP SNPs in **CELF1** and **MS4A6A** were associated with expression of their neighboring genes, **MYBPC3** and **MS4A6A**, respectively, in blood. The IGAP SNP in **DSG2** was an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for **DLGAP1** and **NETO1** in the human frontal cortex. The IGAP SNPs in **ABCA7**, **CD2AP**, and **CD33** each acted as eQTL for AD-associated genes in brain. Our approach for identifying proxies and examining eQTL highlighted potentially impactful, novel gene regulatory phenomena pertinent to the AD phenotype."
T2,Genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with and without hypertension,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors. **Hypertension** is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy. In this study, we investigated the differences in the genetic architecture of AD between hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects in four independent cohorts. Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms ($P < 5E-06$) that were located outside the chromosome **19q13** region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups. The closest genes to 14 polymorphisms were not associated with AD at $P < 5E-06$ in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Also, four of them were located within two chromosomal regions (i.e., **3q13.11** and **17q21.2**) that were not associated with AD at $P < 5E-06$ before. In addition, 30 genes demonstrated evidence of group-specific associations with AD at the false discovery rates (FDR) $< 0.05$ in our gene-based and transcriptome-wide association analyses. The chromosomal regions corresponding to four genes (i.e., **2p13.1**, **9p13.3**, **17q12**, and **18q21.1**) were not associated with AD at $P < 5E-06$ in previous GWAS. These genes may serve as a list of prioritized candidates for future functional studies. Our pathway-enrichment analyses revealed the associations of 11 non-group-specific and four group-specific pathways with AD at FDR $< 0.05$. These findings provided novel insights into the potential genetic heterogeneity of AD among subjects with and without hypertension."
T3,Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new loci and functional pathways influencing Alzheimer's disease risk,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and **AD-by-proxy** (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD ($r_g = 0.81$). Meta-analysis identified **29 risk loci**, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in **immune-related tissues and cell types** (spleen, liver, and **microglia**). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in **lipid-related processes** and degradation of **amyloid precursor proteins**. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD."
T4,"Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer's disease identifies new risk loci and implicates Aβ, tau, immunity and lipid processing","Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify **five new genome-wide loci** (**IQCK**, **ACE**, **ADAM10**, **ADAMTS1**, and **WWOX**), two of which (**ADAM10**, **ACE**) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype **HLA-DR15** as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates **immunity**, **lipid metabolism**, **tau binding proteins**, and **amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism**, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for **rare variants** ($P = 1.32 \times 10^{-7}$), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education."
T5,Identification of genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease across age,"The risk of **APOE** for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is modified by age. Beyond APOE, the polygenic architecture may also be heterogeneous across age. We aim to investigate age-related genetic heterogeneity of AD and identify genomic loci with differential effects across age. Stratified gene-based genome-wide association studies and polygenic variation analyses were performed in the **younger (60-79 years, N = 14,895)** and **older ($\geq 80$ years, N = 6559)** age-at-onset groups using Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data. We showed a **moderate genetic correlation** ($r_g = 0.64$) between the two age groups, supporting genetic heterogeneity. Heritability explained by variants on chromosome 19 (harboring APOE) was significantly larger in younger than in older onset group ($p < 0.05$). **APOE region**, **BIN1**, **OR2S2**, **MS4A4E**, and **PICALM** were identified at the gene-based genome-wide significance ($p < 2.73 \times 10^{-6}$) with larger effects at younger age (except MS4A4E). For the novel gene **OR2S2**, we further performed leave-one-out analyses, which showed consistent effects across subsamples. Our results suggest using genetically more homogeneous individuals may help detect additional susceptible loci."
T6,Dissecting the genetic relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease,"**Cardiovascular (CV)- and lifestyle-associated risk factors (RFs)** are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beyond the $\varepsilon 4$ allele of **apolipoprotein E (APOE)**, comparatively little is known about whether CV-associated genes also increase risk for AD. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV-associated RFs, namely **body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)**. In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of **plasma lipids** (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR $< 0.05$ we identified **90 SNPs** on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes. In meta-analyses across three independent cohorts, we found **four novel loci** within **MBLAC1** (chromosome 7, meta-$p = 1.44 \times 10^{-9}$), **MINK1** (chromosome 17, meta-$p = 1.98 \times 10^{-7}$) and two chromosome 11 SNPs within the **MTCH2/SPI1** region (closest gene = **DDB2**, meta-$p = 7.01 \times 10^{-7}$ and closest gene = **MYBPC3**, meta-$p = 5.62 \times 10^{-8}$). In a large 'AD-by-proxy' cohort from the UK Biobank, we replicated three of the four novel AD/CV pleiotropic SNPs, namely variants within **MINK1**, **MBLAC1**, and **DDB2**. Expression of **MBLAC1**, **SPI1**, **MINK1** and **DDB2** was differentially altered within postmortem AD brains. Beyond APOE, we show that the polygenic component of AD is enriched for lipid-associated RFs. We pinpoint a subset of cardiovascular-associated genes that strongly increase the risk for AD. Our collective findings support a disease model in which **cardiovascular biology is integral to the development of clinical AD in a subset of individuals**."
T7,Shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and Alzheimer's disease: a large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis,"A growing number of studies clearly demonstrate a substantial link between **metabolic dysfunction** and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially glucose-related dysfunction; one hypothesis for this comorbidity is the presence of a common genetic etiology. We conducted a large-scale cross-trait GWAS to investigate the genetic overlap between AD and **ten metabolic traits**. Among all the metabolic traits, **fasting glucose**, **fasting insulin** and **HDL** were found to be genetically associated with AD. Local genetic covariance analysis found that **19q13 region** had strong local genetic correlation between AD and T2D ($P = 6.78 \times 10^{-22}$), LDL ($P = 1.74 \times 10^{-253}$) and HDL ($P = 7.94 \times 10^{-18}$). Cross-trait meta-analysis identified **4 loci** that were associated with AD and fasting glucose, **3 loci** that were associated with AD and fasting insulin, and **20 loci** that were associated with AD and HDL ($P_{\text{meta}} < 1.6 \times 10^{-8}$, single trait $P < 0.05$). Functional analysis revealed that the shared genes are enriched in **amyloid metabolic process**, **lipoprotein remodeling** and other related biological pathways; also in **pancreas**, **liver**, **blood** and other tissues. Our work identifies common genetic architectures shared between AD and fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HDL, and sheds light on molecular mechanisms underlying the association between metabolic dysregulation and AD."
T8,Genetic Overlap Between Alzheimer's Disease and Bipolar Disorder Implicates the MARK2 and VAC14 Genes,"**Background**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and **bipolar disorder (BIP)** are complex traits influenced by numerous common genetic variants, most of which remain to be detected. Clinical and epidemiological evidence suggest that AD and BIP are related. However, it is not established if this relation is of genetic origin. Here, we applied statistical methods based on the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) framework to detect genetic overlap between AD and BIP and utilized this overlap to increase the power to identify common genetic variants associated with either or both traits. **Methods**: We obtained genome wide association studies data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project part 1 (17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls) and the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium Bipolar Disorder Working Group (20,352 BIP cases and 31,358 controls). We used conditional QQ-plots to assess overlap in common genetic variants between AD and BIP. We exploited the genetic overlap to re-rank test-statistics for AD and BIP and improve detection of genetic variants using the conditional FDR framework. **Results**: Conditional QQ-plots demonstrated a polygenic overlap between AD and BIP. Using conditional FDR, we identified one novel genomic locus associated with AD, and nine novel loci associated with BIP. Further, we identified **two novel loci jointly associated with AD and BIP** implicating the **MARK2** gene (lead SNP rs10792421, conjunctional FDR = 0.030, same direction of effect) and the **VAC14** gene (lead SNP rs11649476, conjunctional FDR = 0.022, opposite direction of effect). **Conclusion**: We found polygenic overlap between AD and BIP and identified novel loci for each trait and two jointly associated loci. Further studies should examine if the shared loci implicating the **MARK2** and **VAC14** genes could explain parts of the shared and distinct features of AD and BIP."
T9,Genome-wide analysis of genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease and related sex disparities,"**Background**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. AD is mainly considered a complex disorder with polygenic inheritance. Despite discovering many susceptibility loci, a major proportion of AD genetic variance remains to be explained. **Methods**: We investigated the genetic architecture of AD in four publicly available independent datasets through genome-wide association, transcriptome-wide association, and gene-based and pathway-based analyses. To explore differences in the genetic basis of AD between males and females, analyses were performed on three samples in each dataset: males and females combined, only males, or only females. **Results**: Our genome-wide association analyses corroborated the associations of several previously detected AD loci and revealed novel significant associations of **35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** outside the chromosome **19q13** region at the suggestive significance level of $p < 5E-06$. These SNPs were mapped to 21 genes in 19 chromosomal regions. Of these, 17 genes were not associated with AD at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations by previous genome-wide association studies. Also, the chromosomal regions corresponding to 8 genes did not contain any previously detected AD-associated SNPs with $p < 5E-06$. Our transcriptome-wide association and gene-based analyses revealed that **26 genes** located in 20 chromosomal regions outside chromosome **19q13** had evidence of potential associations with AD at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Of these, 13 genes/regions did not contain any previously AD-associated SNPs at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations. Most of the newly detected AD-associated SNPs and genes were **sex specific**, indicating **sex disparities in the genetic basis of AD**. Also, **7 of 26 pathways** that showed evidence of associations with AD in our pathway-bases analyses were significant **only in females**. **Conclusions**: Our findings, particularly the newly discovered sex-specific genetic contributors, provide novel insight into the genetic architecture of AD and can advance our understanding of its pathogenesis."
T10,Genetic and lifestyle risk factors for MRI-defined brain infarcts in a population-based setting,"**Objective**: To explore genetic and lifestyle risk factors of **MRI-defined brain infarcts (BI)** in large population-based cohorts. **Methods**: We performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examined associations of vascular risk factors and their genetic risk scores (GRS) with MRI-defined BI and a subset of BI, namely, small subcortical BI (SSBI), in 18 population-based cohorts (n = 20,949) from 5 ethnicities (3,726 with BI, 2,021 with SSBI). Top loci were followed up in 7 population-based cohorts (n = 6,862; 1,483 with BI, 630 with SBBI), and we tested associations with related phenotypes including ischemic stroke and pathologically defined BI. **Results**: The mean prevalence was 17.7% for BI and 10.5% for SSBI, steeply rising after age 65. Two loci showed genome-wide significant association with BI: **FBN2**, $p = 1.77 \times 10^{-8}$; and **LINC00539/ZDHHC20**, $p = 5.82 \times 10^{-9}$. Both have been associated with blood pressure (BP)-related phenotypes, but did not replicate in the smaller follow-up sample or show associations with related phenotypes. Age- and sex-adjusted associations with BI and SSBI were observed for **BP traits** ($p$ value for BI, $p[\text{BI}] = 9.38 \times 10^{-25}$; $p[\text{SSBI}] = 5.23 \times 10^{-14}$ for **hypertension**), **smoking** ($p[\text{BI}] = 4.4 \times 10^{-10}$; $p[\text{SSBI}] = 1.2 \times 10^{-4}$), **diabetes** ($p[\text{BI}] = 1.7 \times 10^{-8}$; $p[\text{SSBI}] = 2.8 \times 10^{-3}$), **previous cardiovascular disease** ($p[\text{BI}] = 1.0 \times 10^{-18}$; $p[\text{SSBI}] = 2.3 \times 10^{-7}$), **stroke** ($p[\text{BI}] = 3.9 \times 10^{-69}$; $p[\text{SSBI}] = 3.2 \times 10^{-24}$), and MRI-defined **white matter hyperintensity burden** ($p[\text{BI}] = 1.43 \times 10^{-157}$; $p[\text{SSBI}] = 3.16 \times 10^{-106}$), but not with body mass index or cholesterol. GRS of BP traits were associated with BI and SSBI ($p \leq 0.0022$), without indication of directional pleiotropy. **Conclusion**: In this multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis, including over 20,000 population-based participants, we identified genetic risk loci for BI requiring validation once additional large datasets become available. **High BP**, including genetically determined, was the most significant modifiable, causal risk factor for BI."
T11,APOE Promoter Polymorphism-219T/G is an Effect Modifier of the Influence of APOE $\varepsilon 4$ on Alzheimer's Disease Risk in a Multiracial Sample,"Variants in the **APOE** gene region may explain ethnic differences in the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with $\varepsilon 4$. Ethnic differences in allele frequencies for three APOE region SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were identified and tested for association in 19,398 East Asians (EastA), including Koreans and Japanese, 15,836 European ancestry (EuroA) individuals, and 4985 African Americans, and with brain imaging measures of cortical atrophy in sub-samples of Koreans and EuroAs. Among $\varepsilon 4/\varepsilon 4$ individuals, AD risk increased substantially in a dose-dependent manner with the number of **APOE promoter SNP rs405509 T alleles** in EastAs (TT: OR (odds ratio) = 27.02, $p = 8.80 \times 10^{-94}$; GT: OR = 15.87, $p = 2.62 \times 10^{-9}$) and EuroAs (TT: OR = 18.13, $p = 2.69 \times 10^{-108}$; GT: OR = 12.63, $p = 3.44 \times 10^{-64}$), and rs405509-T homozygotes had a younger onset and more severe cortical atrophy than those with G-allele. Functional experiments using APOE promoter fragments demonstrated that **TT lowered APOE expression** in human brain and serum. The modifying effect of rs405509 genotype explained much of the ethnic variability in the AD/$\varepsilon 4$ association, and increasing APOE expression might lower AD risk among $\varepsilon 4$ homozygotes."
T12,Sex differences in the genetic predictors of Alzheimer's pathology,"Autopsy measures of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology have been leveraged as endophenotypes in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, despite evidence of **sex differences** in Alzheimer's disease risk, sex-stratified models have not been incorporated into previous GWAS analyses. We looked for sex-specific genetic associations with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes from six brain bank data repositories. The pooled dataset included 2701 males and 3275 females, the majority of whom were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at autopsy (70%). Sex-stratified GWAS were performed within each dataset and then meta-analysed. Loci that reached genome-wide significance ($P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$) in stratified models were further assessed for sex interactions. Additional analyses were performed in independent datasets leveraging cognitive, neuroimaging and CSF endophenotypes, along with age-at-onset data. Outside of the **APOE** region, one locus on **chromosome 7 (rs34331204)** showed a sex-specific association with **neurofibrillary tangles** among **males** ($P = 2.5 \times 10^{-8}$) but not females ($P = 0.85$, sex-interaction $P = 2.9 \times 10^{-4}$). In follow-up analyses, rs34331204 was also associated with hippocampal volume, executive function, and age-at-onset **only among males**. These results implicate a novel locus that confers **male-specific protection from tau pathology** and highlight the value of assessing genetic associations in a sex-specific manner."
T13,GWAS on family history of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a public health priority for the 21st century. Risk reduction currently revolves around lifestyle changes with much research trying to elucidate the biological underpinnings. We show that self-report of **parental history of Alzheimer's dementia** for case ascertainment in a genome-wide association study of 314,278 participants from UK Biobank (27,696 maternal cases, 14,338 paternal cases) is a valid proxy for an AD genetic study. After meta-analysing with published consortium data (n = 74,046 with 25,580 cases across the discovery and replication analyses), **three new AD-associated loci** ($P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$) are identified. These contain genes relevant for AD and neurodegeneration: **ADAM10**, **BCKDK/KAT8** and **ACE**. Novel gene-based loci include drug targets such as **VKORC1** (warfarin dose). We report evidence that the association of SNPs in the **TOMM40** gene with AD is potentially mediated by both gene expression and DNA methylation in the prefrontal cortex. However, it is likely that multiple variants are affecting the trait and gene methylation/expression. Our discovered loci may help to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying AD and, as they contain genes that are drug targets for other diseases and disorders, warrant further exploration for potential precision medicine applications."
T14,Hidden heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from genetic association studies and other analyses,"Despite evident success in clarifying many important features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) the efficient methods of its prevention and treatment are not yet available. The reasons are likely to be the fact that AD is a multifactorial and **heterogeneous** health disorder with multiple alternative pathways of disease development and progression. The availability of genetic data on individuals participated in longitudinal studies of aging health and longevity, as well as on participants of cross-sectional case-control studies allow for investigating genetic and non-genetic connections with AD and to link the results of these analyses with research findings obtained in clinical, experimental, and molecular biological studies of this health disorder. The objective of this paper is to perform GWAS of AD in several study populations and investigate possible roles of detected genetic factors in developing AD hallmarks and in other health disorders. The data collected in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study (LOADFS) were used in these analyses. The logistic regression and Cox's regression were used as statistical models in GWAS. The results of analyses confirmed strong associations of genetic variants from well-known genes **APOE**, **TOMM40**, **PVRL2 (NECTIN2)**, and **APOC1** with AD. Possible roles of these genes in pathological mechanisms resulting in development of hallmarks of AD are described. Many genes whose connection with AD was detected in other studies showed nominally significant associations with this health disorder in our study. The evidence on genetic connections between AD and vulnerability to infection, as well as between AD and other health disorders, such as **cancer** and **type 2 diabetes**, were investigated. The progress in uncovering hidden heterogeneity in AD would be substantially facilitated if common mechanisms involved in development of AD, its hallmarks, and AD related chronic conditions were investigated in their mutual connection."
T15,CDK5RAP2 gene and tau pathophysiology in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease,"**Introduction**: Because currently known Alzheimer's disease (AD) single-nucleotide polymorphisms only account for a small fraction of the genetic variance in this disease, there is a need to identify new variants associated with AD. **Methods**: Our team performed a genome-wide association study in the Quebec Founder Population isolate to identify novel protective or risk genetic factors for late-onset sporadic AD and examined the impact of these variants on gene expression and AD pathology. **Results**: The **rs10984186** variant is associated with an **increased risk** of developing AD and with a **higher CDK5RAP2 mRNA prevalence in the hippocampus**. On the other hand, the **rs4837766** variant, which is among the best cis-expression quantitative trait loci in the **CDK5RAP2** gene, is associated with **lower mild cognitive impairment/AD risk** and conversion rate. **Discussion**: The rs10984186 risk and rs4837766 protective polymorphic variants of the **CDK5RAP2** gene might act as potent genetic modifiers for AD risk and/or conversion by **modulating the expression of this gene**."
T16,Genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes at prediagnosis stages,"**Introduction**: Genetic associations for endophenotypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in cognitive stages preceding AD have not been thoroughly evaluated. **Methods**: We conducted genome-wide association studies for AD-related endophenotypes including **hippocampal volume**, **logical memory scores**, and **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) $A\beta_{42}$ and total/phosphorylated tau** in cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. **Results**: In **CN subjects**, study-wide significant ($P < 8.3 \times 10^{-9}$) loci were identified for **total tau near SRRM4 and C14orf79** and for **hippocampal volume near MTUS1**. In mild cognitive impairment subjects, study-wide significant association was found with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near **ZNF804B** for logical memory test of delayed recall scores. We found consistent expression patterns of **C14orf40** and **MTUS1** in carriers with risk alleles of expression SNPs and in brains of AD patients, compared with in the noncarriers and in brains of controls. **Discussion**: Our findings for AD-related brain changes before AD provide insight about early AD-related biological processes."
T17,Sex-specific genetic predictors of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of **amyloid-$\beta$ 42 ($A\beta_{42}$) and tau** have been evaluated as endophenotypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies. Although there are **sex differences** in AD risk, sex differences have not been evaluated in genetic studies of AD endophenotypes. We performed sex-stratified and sex interaction genetic analyses of CSF biomarkers to identify sex-specific associations. Data came from a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF $A\beta_{42}$ and tau (1527 males, 1509 females). We evaluated sex interactions at previous loci, performed sex-stratified GWAS to identify sex-specific associations, and evaluated sex interactions at sex-specific GWAS loci. We then evaluated sex-specific associations between prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression at relevant loci and autopsy measures of plaques and tangles using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In $A\beta_{42}$, we observed sex interactions at one previous and one novel locus: **rs316341** within **SERPINB1** ($p = 0.04$) and **rs13115400** near **LINC00290** ($p = 0.002$). These loci showed **stronger associations among females** ($\beta = - 0.03, p = 4.25 \times 10^{-8}$; $\beta = 0.03, p = 3.97 \times 10^{-8}$) than males ($\beta = - 0.02, p = 0.009$; $\beta = 0.01, p = 0.20$). Higher levels of expression of **SERPINB1, SERPINB6, and SERPINB9** in PFC was associated with higher levels of amyloidosis among **females** (corrected $p$ values $< 0.02$) but not males ($p > 0.38$). In total tau, we observed a sex interaction at a previous locus, **rs1393060** proximal to **GMNC** ($p = 0.004$), driven by a **stronger association among females** ($\beta = 0.05, p = 4.57 \times 10^{-10}$) compared to males ($\beta = 0.02, p = 0.03$). There was also a sex-specific association between rs1393060 and **tangle density at autopsy** ($p_{\text{female}} = 0.047$; $p_{\text{male}} = 0.96$), and higher levels of expression of two genes within this locus were associated with **lower tangle density among females** (**OSTN** $p = 0.006$; **CLDN16** $p = 0.002$) but not males ($p \geq 0.32$). Results suggest a **female-specific role for SERPINB1 in amyloidosis** and for **OSTN and CLDN16 in tau pathology**. Sex-specific genetic analyses may improve understanding of AD's genetic architecture."
T18,Genome-wide pleiotropy analysis of neuropathological traits related to Alzheimer's disease,"**Background**: Simultaneous consideration of two neuropathological traits related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been attempted in a genome-wide association study. **Methods**: We conducted **genome-wide pleiotropy analyses** using association summary statistics from the Beecham et al. study ($PLoS\ Genet\ 10:e1004606, 2014$) for AD-related neuropathological traits, including **neuritic plaque (NP)**, **neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)**, and **cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)**. Significant findings were further examined by expression quantitative trait locus and differentially expressed gene analyses in AD vs. control brains using gene expression data. **Results**: Genome-wide significant pleiotropic associations were observed for the joint model of **NP and NFT** ($\text{NP} + \text{NFT}$) with the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) **rs34487851** upstream of **C2orf40** (alias **ECRG4**, $P = 2.4 \times 10^{-8}$) and for the joint model of **NFT and CAA** ($\text{NFT} + \text{CAA}$) with the **HDAC9** SNP **rs79524815** ($P = 1.1 \times 10^{-8}$). Gene-based testing revealed study-wide significant associations ($P \leq 2.0 \times 10^{-6}$) for the $\text{NFT} + \text{CAA}$ outcome with adjacent genes **TRAPPC12**, **TRAPPC12-AS1**, and **ADI1**. Risk alleles of proxy SNPs for rs79524815 were associated with significantly lower expression of **HDAC9** in the brain ($P = 3.0 \times 10^{-3}$), and HDAC9 was significantly downregulated in subjects with AD compared with control subjects in the prefrontal ($P = 7.9 \times 10^{-3}$) and visual ($P = 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$) cortices. **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that pleiotropy analysis is a useful approach to identifying novel genetic associations with complex diseases and their endophenotypes. Functional studies are needed to determine whether **ECRG4** or **HDAC9** is plausible as a therapeutic target."
T19,Selective Genetic Overlap Between Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Diseases of the Frontotemporal Dementia Spectrum,"**Importance**: **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)** is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Although novel ALS genetic variants have been identified, the shared genetic risk between ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders remains poorly understood. **Objectives**: To examine whether there are common genetic variants that determine the risk for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases and to identify their functional pathways. **Design, setting, and participants**: In this study conducted from December 1, 2016, to August 1, 2017, the genetic overlap between ALS, **sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD)**, FTD with TDP-43 inclusions, **Parkinson disease (PD)**, **Alzheimer disease (AD)**, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were systematically investigated in 124 876 cases and controls. No participants were excluded from this study. Diagnoses were established using consensus criteria. **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were a list of novel loci and their functional pathways in ALS, FTD, PSP, and ALS mouse models. **Results**: Among 124 876 cases and controls, genome-wide conjunction analyses of ALS, FTD, PD, AD, CBD, and PSP revealed **significant genetic overlap between ALS and FTD** at known ALS loci: **rs13302855 and rs3849942** (nearest gene, **C9orf72**; $P = .03$ for rs13302855 and $P = .005$ for rs3849942) and **rs4239633** (nearest gene, **UNC13A**; $P = .03$). Significant genetic overlap was also found between ALS and PSP at **rs7224296**, which tags the **MAPT H1 haplotype** (nearest gene, **NSF**; $P = .045$). Shared risk genes were enriched for pathways involving **neuronal function and development**. At a conditional FDR $P < .05$, 22 novel ALS polymorphisms were found, including **rs538622** (nearest gene, **ERGIC1**; $P = .03$ for ALS and FTD), which modifies **BNIP1** expression in human brains (35 of 137 females; mean age, 59 years; $P = .001$). **BNIP1 expression** was significantly **reduced** in spinal cord motor neurons from patients with ALS (4 controls: mean age, 60.5 years, mean [SE] value, 3984 [760.8] arbitrary units [AU]; 7 patients with ALS: mean age, 56 years, mean [SE] value, 1999 [274.1] AU; $P = .02$), in an ALS mouse model (mean [SE] value, 13.75 [0.09] AU for 2 SOD1 WT mice and 11.45 [0.03] AU for 2 SOD1 G93A mice; $P = .002$) and in brains of patients with PSP (80 controls: 39 females; mean age, 82 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.2] AU; 84 patients with PSP: 33 females, mean age 74 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.1] AU; $\beta = -0.19$; $P = .009$) or FTD (11 controls: 4 females; mean age, 67 years; mean [SE] value, 6.74 [0.05] AU; 17 patients with FTD: 10 females; mean age, 69 years; mean [SE] value, 6.53 [0.04] AU; $P = .005$). **Conclusions and relevance**: This study found **novel genetic overlap between ALS and diseases of the FTD spectrum**, that the **MAPT H1 haplotype confers risk for ALS**, and identified the mitophagy-associated, proapoptotic protein **BNIP1** as an ALS risk gene. Together, these findings suggest that sporadic ALS may represent a selectively pleiotropic, polygenic disorder."
T20,The GWAS Risk Genes for Depression May Be Actively Involved in Alzheimer's Disease,"**Depression** is one of the most frequent psychiatric symptoms observed in people during the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that genetic factors conferring risk of depression might affect AD development. In this study, we screened **31 genes**, which were located in **19 risk loci for major depressive disorder (MDD)** identified by two recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in AD patients at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. Association analysis of common variants was performed by using summary statistics of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), and association analysis of rare variants was conducted by sequencing the entire coding region of the 31 MDD risk genes in 107 Han Chinese patients with early-onset and/or familial AD. We found that common and rare variants of **L3MBTL2** were significantly associated with AD. mRNA expression levels of **18 MDD risk genes**, in particular **SORCS3** and **OAT**, were differentially expressed in AD brain tissues. **13 MDD risk genes** were predicted to physically interact with core AD genes. The involvement of **HACE1**, **NEGR1**, and **SLC6A15** in AD was supported by convergent lines of evidence. Taken together, our results showed that MDD risk genes might play an **active role in AD pathology** and supported the notion that depression might be the ""common cold"" of psychiatry."
T21,"Genetic Study of White Matter Integrity in UK Biobank ($N=8448$) and the Overlap With Stroke, Depression, and Dementia","**Background and purpose**: **Structural integrity of the white matter** is a marker of cerebral small vessel disease, which is the major cause of **vascular dementia** and a quarter of all strokes. Genetic studies provide a way to obtain novel insights in the disease mechanism underlying cerebral small vessel disease. The aim was to identify common variants associated with microstructural integrity of the white matter and to elucidate the relationships of white matter structural integrity with **stroke**, **major depressive disorder**, and **Alzheimer disease**. **Methods**: This genome-wide association analysis included 8448 individuals from UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study that recruited individuals from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, aged 40 to 69 years. Microstructural integrity was measured as **fractional anisotropy- (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)**-derived parameters on diffusion tensor images. White matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHV) were assessed on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. **Results**: We identified **1 novel locus** at genome-wide significance (**VCAN** [versican]: rs13164785; $P=3.7 \times 10^{-18}$ for MD and rs67827860; $P=1.3 \times 10^{-14}$ for FA). LD score regression showed a significant genome-wide correlation between FA, MD, and WMHV ($\text{FA}-\text{WMHV}\ r_G 0.39 [\text{SE}, 0.15]$; $\text{MD}-\text{WMHV}\ r_G 0.56 [\text{SE}, 0.19]$). In polygenic risk score analysis, FA, MD, and WMHV were significantly associated with **lacunar stroke**, MD with **major depressive disorder**, and WMHV with **Alzheimer disease**. **Conclusions**: Genetic variants within the **VCAN** gene may play a role in the mechanisms underlying microstructural integrity of the white matter in the brain measured as FA and MD. Mechanisms underlying white matter alterations are **shared with cerebrovascular disease**, and inherited differences in white matter microstructure impact on **Alzheimer disease and major depressive disorder**."
T22,Genetic architecture of sporadic frontotemporal dementia and overlap with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"**Background**: Clinical, pathological and genetic overlap between **sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD)**, **Alzheimer's disease (AD)** and **Parkinson's disease (PD)** has been suggested; however, the relationship between these disorders is still not well understood. Here we evaluated genetic overlap between FTD, AD and PD to assess shared pathobiology and identify novel genetic variants associated with increased risk for FTD. **Methods**: Summary statistics were obtained from the International FTD Genomics Consortium, International PD Genetics Consortium and International Genomics of AD Project ($n>75 000$ cases and controls). We used conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) to evaluate genetic pleiotropy and conditional FDR to identify novel FTD-associated SNPs. Relevant variants were further evaluated for expression quantitative loci. **Results**: We observed SNPs within the **HLA**, **MAPT** and **APOE** regions jointly contributing to increased risk for FTD and AD or PD. By conditioning on polymorphisms associated with PD and AD, we found **11 loci** associated with increased risk for FTD. Meta-analysis across two independent FTD cohorts revealed a genome-wide signal within the **APOE** region (**rs6857**, 3'-UTR=**PVRL2**, $p=2.21 \times 10^{-12}$), and a suggestive signal for **rs1358071** within the **MAPT** region (intronic=**CRHR1**, $p=4.91 \times 10^{-7}$) with the effect allele tagging the **H1 haplotype**. Pleiotropic SNPs at the **HLA** and **MAPT** loci associated with expression changes in **cis-genes** supporting involvement of **intracellular vesicular trafficking**, **immune response** and **endo/lysosomal processes**. **Conclusions**: Our findings demonstrate **genetic pleiotropy** in these neurodegenerative diseases and indicate that sporadic FTD is a polygenic disorder where multiple pleiotropic loci with small effects contribute to increased disease risk."
T23,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with cognitive decline at Alzheimer's disease conversion within mild cognitive impairment patients,"**Introduction**: The growing public threat of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised the urgency to quantify the degree of **cognitive decline** during the conversion process of **mild cognitive impairment (MCI)** to AD and its underlying genetic pathway. The aim of this article was to test genetic common variants associated with **accelerated cognitive decline** after the conversion of MCI to AD. **Methods**: In 583 subjects with MCI enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; ADNI-1, ADNI-Go, and ADNI-2), 245 MCI participants converted to AD at follow-up. We tested the interaction effects between individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms and AD diagnosis trajectory on the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition scores. **Results**: Our findings reveal **six genes**, including **BDH1**, **ST6GAL1**, **RAB20**, **PDS5B**, **ADARB2**, and **SPSB1**, which are directly or indirectly related to MCI conversion to AD. **Discussion**: This genome-wide association study sheds light on a **genetic mechanism of longitudinal cognitive changes** during the transition period from MCI to AD."
T24,"Rare coding variants in PLCG2, ABI3, and TREM2 implicate microglial-mediated innate immunity in Alzheimer's disease","We identified **rare coding variants** associated with Alzheimer's disease in a three-stage case-control study of 85,133 subjects. In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants ($P < 1 \times 10^{-4}$) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations ($P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$) using imputed genotypes. We observed **three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants** associated with Alzheimer's disease: a **protective variant** in **PLCG2** (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, $P = 5.38 \times 10^{-10}$, OR = 0.68, $\text{MAF}_{\text{cases}} = 0.0059$, $\text{MAF}_{\text{controls}} = 0.0093$), a **risk variant** in **ABI3** (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, $P = 4.56 \times 10^{-10}$, OR = 1.43, $\text{MAF}_{\text{cases}} = 0.011$, $\text{MAF}_{\text{controls}} = 0.008$), and a **new genome-wide significant variant** in **TREM2** (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, $P = 1.55 \times 10^{-14}$, OR = 1.67, $\text{MAF}_{\text{cases}} = 0.0143$, $\text{MAF}_{\text{controls}} = 0.0089$), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in **microglia** and highlight an **immune-related protein-protein interaction network** enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the **microglia-mediated innate immune response** contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease."
T25,Genetic assessment of age-associated Alzheimer disease risk: Development and validation of a polygenic hazard score,"**Background**: Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of utmost importance. Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in **APOE** and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction. **Methods and findings**: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at $p < 10^{-5}$). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a **polygenic hazard score (PHS)** for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total $n = 20,680$). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among **APOE $\varepsilon 3/3$ individuals**, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than **10 y** between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.62-4.24, $p = 1.0 \times 10^{-22}$). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, $r = 0.90, p = 1.1 \times 10^{-26}$) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, $p = 1.5 \times 10^{-10}$), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, **Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles**, $p = 3.9 \times 10^{-6}$, and **Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques**, $p = 6.8 \times 10^{-6}$) and *in vivo* markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, **volume loss within the entorhinal cortex**, $p = 6.3 \times 10^{-6}$, and **hippocampus**, $p = 7.9 \times 10^{-5}$). Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use. **Conclusions**: We have developed a **PHS** for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, **polygenic architecture** plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials."
T26,Genome-wide association study identifies four novel loci associated with Alzheimer's endophenotypes and disease modifiers,"**Abstract**: More than 20 genetic loci have been associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but reported genome-wide significant loci do not account for all the estimated heritability and provide little information about underlying biological mechanisms. Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or **endophenotypes**, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of **amyloid beta ($A\beta_{42}$), tau, and phosphorylated tau ($ptau_{181}$) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. **Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with $ptau_{181}$**, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. **Two novel loci** associated with $A\beta_{42}$ near **GLIS1** on **1p32.3** ($\beta = -0.059, P = 2.08 \times 10^{-8}$) and within **SERPINB1** on **6p25** ($\beta = -0.025, P = 1.72 \times 10^{-8}$) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, $P = 3.43 \times 10^{-2}$), disease progression (GLIS1: $\beta = 0.277, P = 1.92 \times 10^{-2}$), and age at onset (SERPINB1: $\beta = 0.043, P = 4.62 \times 10^{-3}$). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of **SERPINB1** in various tissues, including the **hippocampus**, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an A$\beta$-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest **CLU** and **FERMT2** may influence CSF $A\beta_{42}$ ($P = 0.001$ and $P = 0.009$, respectively) and the **INPP5D** locus may affect $ptau_{181}$ levels ($P = 0.009$); larger studies are necessary to verify these results. Together the findings from this study can be used to inform future AD studies."
T27,Investigating the genetic relationship between Alzheimer's disease and cancer using GWAS summary statistics,"**Abstract**: Growing evidence from both epidemiology and basic science suggest an inverse association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer. We examined the genetic relationship between AD and various cancer types using GWAS summary statistics from the IGAP and GAME-ON consortia. Sample size ranged from 9931 to 54,162; SNPs were imputed to the 1000 Genomes European panel. Our results based on cross-trait LD Score regression showed a **significant positive genetic correlation** between AD and **five cancers combined** (colon, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung; $r_g = 0.17, P = 0.04$), and specifically with **breast cancer** (ER-negative and overall; $r_g = 0.21$ and $0.18, P = 0.035$ and $0.034$) and **lung cancer** (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and overall; $r_g = 0.31, 0.38$ and $0.30, P = 0.029, 0.016$, and $0.006$). Estimating the genetic correlation in specific functional categories revealed mixed positive and negative signals, notably stronger at annotations associated with **increased enhancer activity**. This suggests a role of **gene expression regulators** in the shared genetic etiology between AD and cancer, and that some shared variants modulate disease risk concordantly while others have effects in opposite directions. Due to power issues, we did not detect cross-phenotype associations at individual SNPs. This genetic overlap is not likely driven by a handful of major loci. Our study is the first to examine the co-heritability of AD and cancer leveraging large-scale GWAS results. The functional categories highlighted in this study need further investigation to illustrate the details of the genetic sharing and to bridge between different levels of associations."
T28,"Two novel loci, COBL and SLC10A2, for Alzheimer's disease in African Americans","**Introduction**: **African Americans' (AAs)** late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) genetic risk profile is incompletely understood. Including clinical covariates in genetic analyses using **informed conditioning** might improve study power. **Methods**: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AAs employing informed conditioning in 1825 LOAD cases and 3784 cognitively normal controls. We derived a posterior liability conditioned on **age, sex, diabetes status, current smoking status, educational attainment**, and affection status, with parameters informed by external prevalence information. We assessed association between the posterior liability and a genome-wide set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), controlling for **APOE** and **ABCA7**, identified previously in a LOAD GWAS of AAs. **Results**: **Two SNPs at novel loci**, **rs112404845** ($P = 3.8 \times 10^{-8}$), upstream of **COBL**, and **rs16961023** ($P = 4.6 \times 10^{-8}$), downstream of **SLC10A2**, obtained genome-wide significant evidence of association with the posterior liability. **Discussion**: An **informed conditioning approach** can detect LOAD genetic associations in AAs not identified by traditional GWAS."
T29,"Genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening identifies the Alzheimer's genetic risk factor FERMT2 as a major modulator of APP metabolism","**Abstract**: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified **19 susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD)**. However, understanding how these genes are involved in the pathophysiology of AD is one of the main challenges of the ""post-GWAS"" era. At least 123 genes are located within the 19 susceptibility loci; hence, a conventional approach (studying the genes one by one) would not be time- and cost-effective. We therefore developed a **genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening approach** and used it to assess the functional impact of gene under-expression on **APP metabolism**. We found that 832 genes modulated APP metabolism. Eight of these genes were located within AD susceptibility loci. Only **FERMT2** (a $\beta 3$-integrin co-activator) was also significantly associated with a variation in **cerebrospinal fluid $A\beta$ peptide levels** in 2886 AD cases. Lastly, we showed that the **under-expression of FERMT2 increases $A\beta$ peptide production** by raising levels of mature APP at the cell surface and facilitating its recycling. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that **FERMT2 modulates the AD risk by regulating APP metabolism and $A\beta$ peptide production**."
T30,Transethnic genome-wide scan identifies novel Alzheimer's disease loci,"**Introduction**: Genetic loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified in whites of European ancestry, but the genetic architecture of AD among other populations is less understood. **Methods**: We conducted a **transethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS)** for late-onset AD in Stage 1 sample including whites of European Ancestry, **African-Americans, Japanese, and Israeli-Arabs** assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. Suggestive results from Stage 1 from novel loci were followed up using summarized results in the International Genomics Alzheimer's Project GWAS dataset. **Results**: **Genome-wide significant (GWS) associations** in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based tests ($P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$) were identified for SNPs in **PFDN1/HBEGF**, **USP6NL/ECHDC3**, and **BZRAP1-AS1** and for the interaction of the (**apolipoprotein E**) **APOE $\varepsilon 4$ allele with NFIC SNP**. We also obtained GWS evidence ($P < 2.7 \times 10^{-6}$) for **gene-based association** in the total sample with a **novel locus, TPBG** ($P = 1.8 \times 10^{-6}$)."
T31,Genetic Comparison of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Persons With Alzheimer Disease Neuropathology,"**Objective**: The objective was to determine whether **symptomatic** and **asymptomatic** persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology have different allele counts for single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been associated with clinical late-onset AD. **Methods**: Data came from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set and Neuropathology Data Set, and the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). Participants had low to high AD neuropathologic change. The 22 known/suspected genes associated with late-onset AD were considered. ""Symptomatic"" was defined as Clinical Dementia Rating global score $>0$. **Results**: Sixty-eight asymptomatic and 521 symptomatic participants met inclusion criteria. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with **ABCA7** ($\text{OR}=1.66$; 95% CI, 1.03-2.85) and **MAPT** ($\text{OR}=2.18$; CI, 1.26-3.77) were associated with symptomatic status. In stratified analyses, loci containing **CD2AP** ($\text{OR}=0.35$; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74), **ZCWPW1** ($\text{OR}=2.98$; 95% CI, 1.34-6.86), and **MAPT** ($\text{OR}=3.73$, 95% CI, 1.30-11.76) were associated with symptomatic status in **APOE $\varepsilon 4$ carriers**. **Conclusions**: These findings potentially explain some of the variation in whether a person with AD neuropathology expresses symptoms. Understanding why some people remain **cognitively normal despite having AD neuropathology** could identify pathways to disease heterogeneity and guide treatment trials."
T32,Implication of the APP Gene in Intellectual Abilities,"**Background**: Cognitive functions are highly heritable and polygenic, though the source of this genetic influence is unclear. On the neurobiological level, these functions rely on effective neuroplasticity, in which the **activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (ARC)** plays an essential role. **Objectives**: To examine whether the ARC gene complex may contribute to the genetic components of **intellectual function (IQ)** given the crucial role of ARC in brain plasticity and memory formation. **Methods**: The **ARC complex** was tested for association with IQ in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ($\text{ALSPAC}, N = 5,165$). As Alzheimer's disease (AD) shares genetics with cognitive functioning, the association was followed up in an AD sample (17,008 cases, 37,154 controls). **Results**: The ARC complex revealed association with **verbal and total IQ** (empirical $p = 0.027$ and $0.041$, respectively) in the ALSPAC. The strongest single variant signal (**rs2830077**; empirical $p = 0.018$), within the **APP gene**, was confirmed in the AD sample ($p = 2.76E-03$). Functional analyses of this variant showed its preferential binding to the **transcription factor CP2**. **Discussion**: This study implicates **APP in childhood IQ**. While follow-up studies are needed, this observation could help elucidate the etiology of disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction, such as AD."
T33,Linking Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes: Novel shared susceptibility genes detected by cFDR approach,"**Background**: Both **type 2 diabetes (T2D)** and Alzheimer's disease (AD) occur commonly in the aging populations and T2D has been considered as an important risk factor for AD. The heritability of both diseases is estimated to be over 50%. However, common pleiotropic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/loci have not been well-defined. The aim of this study is to analyze two large public accessible GWAS datasets to identify novel common genetic loci for T2D and/or AD. **Methods and materials**: The recently developed novel **conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach** was used to analyze the summary GWAS datasets from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and Diabetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) to identify novel susceptibility genes for AD and T2D. **Results**: We identified **78 SNPs** (including 58 novel SNPs) that were associated with AD in Europeans **conditional on T2D** ($\text{cFDR}<0.05$). **66 T2D SNPs** (including 40 novel SNPs) were identified by conditioning on SNPs association with AD ($\text{cFDR}<0.05$). A **conjunction-cFDR (ccFDR) analysis detected 8 pleiotropic SNPs** with a significance threshold of $\text{ccFDR}<0.05$ for both AD and T2D, of which **5 SNPs** (**rs6982393, rs4734295, rs7812465, rs10510109, rs2421016**) were novel findings. Furthermore, among the 8 SNPs annotated at 6 different genes, **3 corresponding genes** **TP53INP1, TOMM40 and C8orf38** were related to **mitochondrial dysfunction**, critically involved in **oxidative stress**, which potentially contribute to the etiology of both AD and T2D. **Conclusion**: Our study provided evidence for **shared genetic loci between T2D and AD** in European subjects by using cFDR and ccFDR analyses. These results may provide novel insight into the etiology and potential therapeutic targets of T2D and/or AD."
T34,"Gene-based association study of genes linked to hippocampal sclerosis of aging neuropathology: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and KCNMB2","**Abstract**: **Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging)** is a common neurodegenerative condition associated with dementia. To learn more about genetic risk of HS-Aging pathology, we tested gene-based associations of the **GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and KCNMB2** genes, which were reported to be associated with HS-Aging pathology in previous studies. Genetic data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, linked to autopsy-derived neuropathological outcomes from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Of the 3251 subjects included in the study, 271 (8.3%) were identified as an HS-Aging case. The **significant gene-based association between the ABCC9 gene and HS-Aging** appeared to be driven by a region in which a significant haplotype-based association was found. We tested this haplotype as an expression quantitative trait locus using 2 different public-access brain gene expression databases. The HS-Aging pathology **protective ABCC9 haplotype was associated with decreased ABCC9 expression**, indicating a possible **toxic gain of function**."
T35,Discovery of gene-gene interactions across multiple independent data sets of late onset Alzheimer disease from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium,"**Abstract**: Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) has a complex genetic etiology, involving locus heterogeneity, polygenic inheritance, and **gene-gene interactions**; however, the investigation of interactions in recent genome-wide association studies has been limited. We used a biological knowledge-driven approach to evaluate gene-gene interactions for consistency across 13 data sets from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. **Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP pairs** within **3 gene-gene combinations** were identified: **SIRT1 $\times$ ABCB1**, **PSAP $\times$ PEBP4**, and **GRIN2B $\times$ ADRA1A**. In addition, we extend a previously identified interaction from an endophenotype analysis between **RYR3 $\times$ CACNA1C**. Finally, post hoc gene expression analyses of the implicated SNPs further implicate SIRT1 and ABCB1, and implicate **CDH23** which was most recently identified as an AD risk locus in an epigenetic analysis of AD. The observed interactions in this article highlight ways in which genotypic variation related to disease may depend on the genetic context in which it occurs. Further, our results highlight the utility of evaluating genetic interactions to explain additional variance in AD risk and identify novel molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis."
T36,Alzheimer's Disease Risk Polymorphisms Regulate Gene Expression in the ZCWPW1 and the CELF1 Loci,"**Abstract**: Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a genetically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. Recent large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than twenty loci that modify risk for AD. Despite the identification of these loci, little progress has been made in identifying the functional variants that explain the association with AD risk. Thus, we sought to determine whether the novel LOAD GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alter expression of LOAD GWAS genes and whether expression of these genes is altered in AD brains. The majority of LOAD GWAS SNPs occur in gene dense regions under large linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, making it unclear which gene(s) are modified by the SNP. Thus, we tested for **brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)** between LOAD GWAS SNPs and SNPs in high LD with the LOAD GWAS SNPs in all of the genes within the GWAS loci. We found a significant eQTL between **rs1476679** and **PILRB** and **GATS**, which occurs within the **ZCWPW1** locus. **PILRB and GATS expression levels**, within the ZCWPW1 locus, were also associated with AD status. **Rs7120548** was associated with **MTCH2** expression, which occurs within the **CELF1** locus. Additionally, expression of several genes within the CELF1 locus, including MTCH2, were highly correlated with one another and were associated with AD status. We further demonstrate that **PILRB**, as well as other genes within the GWAS loci, are most highly expressed in **microglia**. These findings together with the function of PILRB as a **DAP12 receptor** supports the critical role of **microglia** and **neuroinflammation** in AD risk."
T37,Association Between Genetic Traits for Immune-Mediated Diseases and Alzheimer Disease,"**Importance**: Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, places a large burden on families and society. Although epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between **inflammation** and AD, their relationship is not well understood and could have implications for treatment and prevention strategies. **Objective**: To determine whether a subset of genes involved with increased risk of inflammation are also associated with increased risk for AD. **Design, setting, and participants**: In a genetic epidemiology study conducted in July 2015, we systematically investigated **genetic overlap between AD** (International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project stage 1) and **Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and psoriasis** using summary data from genome-wide association studies at multiple academic clinical research centers. $P$ values and odds ratios from genome-wide association studies of more than 100 000 individuals were from previous comparisons of patients vs respective control cohorts. Diagnosis for each disorder was previously established for the parent study using consensus criteria. **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the pleiotropic (conjunction) false discovery rate $P$ value. Follow-up for candidate variants included **neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology**; longitudinal **Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores** as a measure of cognitive dysfunction (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative); and gene expression in AD vs control brains (Gene Expression Omnibus data). **Results**: **Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms** (false discovery rate $P < .05$) were associated with both AD and immune-mediated diseases. Of these, **rs2516049** (closest gene **HLA-DRB5**; conjunction false discovery rate $P = .04$ for AD and psoriasis, $5.37 \times 10^{-5}$ for AD, and $6.03 \times 10^{-15}$ for psoriasis) and **rs12570088** (closest gene **IPMK**; conjunction false discovery rate $P = .009$ for AD and Crohn disease, $P = 5.73 \times 10^{-6}$ for AD, and $6.57 \times 10^{-5}$ for Crohn disease) demonstrated the same direction of allelic effect between AD and the immune-mediated diseases. Both rs2516049 and rs12570088 were significantly associated with **neurofibrillary tangle pathology** ($P = .01352$ and $.03151$, respectively); rs2516049 additionally correlated with **longitudinal decline on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores** ($\beta [\text{SE}], 0.405 [0.190]; P = .03$). Regarding gene expression, **HLA-DRA and IPMK transcript expression** was significantly altered in AD brains compared with control brains (HLA-DRA: $\beta [\text{SE}], 0.155 [0.024]; P = 1.97 \times 10^{-10}$; IPMK: $\beta [\text{SE}], -0.096 [0.013]; P = 7.57 \times 10^{-13}$). **Conclusions and relevance**: Our findings demonstrate **genetic overlap between AD and immune-mediated diseases** and suggest that **immune system processes** influence AD pathogenesis and progression."
T38,Rare Functional Variant in TM2D3 is Associated with Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease,"We performed an **exome-wide association analysis** in 1393 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases and 8141 controls from the CHARGE consortium. We found that a **rare variant (P155L) in TM2D3** was enriched in **Icelanders** ($\sim 0.5\%$ versus $<0.05\%$ in other European populations). In 433 LOAD cases and 3903 controls from the Icelandic AGES sub-study, **P155L** was associated with **increased risk and earlier onset of LOAD** [odds ratio (95% CI) = 7.5 (3.5-15.9), $p = 6.6 \times 10^{-9}$]. Mutation in the *Drosophila* TM2D3 homolog, **almondex**, causes a phenotype similar to **loss of Notch/Presenilin signaling**. Human **TM2D3** is capable of rescuing these phenotypes, but this activity is abolished by P155L, establishing it as a functionally damaging allele. Our results establish a rare **TM2D3** variant in association with LOAD susceptibility, and together with prior work suggests possible links to the **$\beta$-amyloid cascade**."
T39,Genetic risk factors for the posterior cortical atrophy variant of Alzheimer's disease,"**Introduction**: The genetics underlying **posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)**, typically a rare variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD), remain uncertain. **Methods**: We genotyped 302 PCA patients from 11 centers, calculated risk at 24 loci for AD/DLB and performed an exploratory genome-wide association study. **Results**: We confirm that variation in/near **APOE/TOMM40** ($P = 6 \times 10^{-14}$) alters PCA risk, but with **smaller effect than for typical AD** (PCA: odds ratio [OR] = 2.03, typical AD: OR = 2.83, $P = .0007$). We found evidence for risk in/near **CR1** ($P = 7 \times 10^{-4}$), **ABCA7** ($P = .02$) and **BIN1** ($P = .04$). ORs at variants near **INPP5D** and **NME8** did not overlap between PCA and typical AD. Exploratory genome-wide association studies confirmed **APOE** and identified **three novel loci**: **rs76854344** near **CNTNAP5** ($P = 8 \times 10^{-10}\ \text{OR} = 1.9 [1.5-2.3]$); **rs72907046** near **FAM46A** ($P = 1 \times 10^{-9}\ \text{OR} = 3.2 [2.1-4.9]$); and **rs2525776** near **SEMA3C** ($P = 1 \times 10^{-8}, \text{OR} = 3.3 [2.1-5.1]$). **Discussion**: We provide evidence for **genetic risk factors specifically related to PCA**. We identify three candidate loci that, if replicated, may provide insights into selective vulnerability and phenotypic diversity in AD."
T40,Variants in ACPP are associated with cerebrospinal fluid Prostatic Acid Phosphatase levels,"**Background**: **Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP)** is an enzyme that is produced primarily in the prostate and functions as a cell growth regulator and potential tumor suppressor. Understanding the genetic regulation of this enzyme is important because PAP plays an important role in prostate cancer and is expressed in other tissues such as the brain. **Methods**: We tested association between 5.8 M SNPs and **PAP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** across 543 individuals in two datasets using linear regression. We then performed meta-analyses using METAL with a significance threshold of $p < 5 \times 10^{-8}$ and removed SNPs where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets, identifying 289 candidate SNPs that affect PAP cerebrospinal fluid levels. We analyzed each of these SNPs individually and prioritized SNPs that had biologically meaningful functional annotations in wANNOVAR (e.g. non-synonymous, stop gain, 3' UTR, etc.) or had a RegulomeDB score less than 3. **Results**: **Thirteen SNPs** met our criteria, suggesting they are candidate causal alleles that underlie **ACPP** regulation and expression. **Conclusions**: Given PAP's expression in the brain and its role as a cell-growth regulator and tumor suppressor, our results have important implications in brain health such as cancer and other brain diseases including neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) and mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia)."
T41,Variants in CCL16 are associated with blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid CCL16 protein levels,"**Background**: **CCL16** is a **chemokine** predominantly expressed in the liver, but is also found in the blood and brain, and is known to play important roles in **immune response** and **angiogenesis**. Little is known about the gene's regulation. **Methods**: Here, we test for potential causal SNPs that affect **CCL16 protein levels** in both **blood plasma** and **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** in a genome-wide association study across two datasets. We then use METAL to performed meta-analyses with a significance threshold of $p < 5 \times 10^{-8}$. We removed SNPs where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets. **Results**: We identify **10 SNPs associated with increased CCL16 protein levels in both biological fluids**. **Conclusions**: Our efforts will help researchers understand how CCL16 is regulated in both CSF and plasma, which could be beneficial in research for the immune system and reproduction."
T42,Novel genetic loci underlying human intracranial volume identified through genome-wide association,"**Abstract**: **Intracranial volume** reflects the maximally attained brain size during development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered **five previously unknown loci for intracranial volume** and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci were also associated with **adult human stature**, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for height. We found a **high genetic correlation with child head circumference** ($\rho_{\text{genetic}} = 0.748$), which indicates a similar genetic background and allowed us to identify **four additional loci** through meta-analysis ($N_{\text{combined}} = 37,345$). Variants for intracranial volume were also related to **childhood and adult cognitive function**, and **Parkinson's disease**, and were enriched near genes involved in **growth pathways**, including **PI3K-AKT signaling**. These findings identify the biological underpinnings of intracranial volume and their link to physiological and pathological traits."
T43,A novel Alzheimer disease locus located near the gene encoding tau protein,"**Abstract**: **APOE $\varepsilon 4$**, the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), may mask effects of other loci. We re-analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) Consortium in **APOE $\varepsilon 4+$** (10 352 cases and 9207 controls) and **APOE $\varepsilon 4-$** (7184 cases and 26 968 controls) subgroups as well as in the total sample testing for interaction between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and APOE $\varepsilon 4$ status. Suggestive associations ($P<1 \times 10^{-4}$) in stage 1 were evaluated in an independent sample (stage 2) containing 4203 subjects (APOE $\varepsilon 4+$: 1250 cases and 536 controls; APOE $\varepsilon 4-$: 718 cases and 1699 controls). Among **APOE $\varepsilon 4-$ subjects**, **novel genome-wide significant (GWS) association** was observed with **17 SNPs** (all between **KANSL1** and **LRRC37A** on **chromosome 17 near MAPT**) in a meta-analysis of the stage 1 and stage 2 data sets (best SNP, **rs2732703**, $P=5.8 \times 10^{-9}$). Conditional analysis revealed that rs2732703 accounted for association signals in the entire 100-kilobase region that includes **MAPT**. Except for previously identified AD loci showing stronger association in APOE $\varepsilon 4+$ subjects (**CR1** and **CLU**) or APOE $\varepsilon 4-$ subjects (**MS4A6A/MS4A4A/MS4A6E**), no other SNPs were significantly associated with AD in a specific APOE genotype subgroup. In addition, the finding in the stage 1 sample that AD risk is significantly influenced by the interaction of APOE with **rs1595014 in TMEM106B** ($P=1.6 \times 10^{-7}$) is noteworthy, because TMEM106B variants have previously been associated with risk of **frontotemporal dementia**. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that **rs113986870**, one of the GWS SNPs near rs2732703, is significantly associated with four **KANSL1** probes that target transcription of the first translated exon and an untranslated exon in **hippocampus** ($P \leqslant 1.3 \times 10^{-8}$), **frontal cortex** ($P \leqslant 1.3 \times 10^{-9}$) and **temporal cortex** ($P\leqslant 1.2 \times 10^{-11}$). Rs113986870 is also strongly associated with a **MAPT** probe that targets transcription of alternatively spliced exon 3 in frontal cortex ($P=9.2 \times 10^{-6}$) and temporal cortex ($P=2.6 \times 10^{-6}$). Our **APOE-stratified GWAS** is the first to show GWS association for AD with SNPs in the **chromosome 17q21.31 region**. Replication of this finding in independent samples is needed to verify that SNPs in this region have significantly stronger effects on AD risk in persons lacking APOE $\varepsilon 4$ compared with persons carrying this allele, and if this is found to hold, further examination of this region and studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism(s) are warranted."
T44,Age-dependent effects of APOE $\varepsilon 4$ in preclinical Alzheimer's disease,"**Objective**: The **$\varepsilon 4$ allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE)** is the strongest known common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and alters age of onset in retrospective studies. Here, we longitudinally test the effects of APOE $\varepsilon 4$ genotype and **age** during progression from normal cognition to AD. **Methods**: Using data from 5381 **cognitively normal older individuals** and Cox proportional hazards models, we longitudinally tested the effects of APOE genotype on **progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD** in **four age strata** ($<60, 60-70, 70-80, 80+$) and with a sliding window approach between ages 60 and 85. **Results**: We found that **APOE $\varepsilon 4$ carrier status and dosage significantly influenced progression to MCI or AD in all four age groups** and that APOE $\varepsilon 4$-associated progression risk **peaked between ages 70 and 75**. We confirmed APOE $\varepsilon 4$-associated progression risk in a subset of the cohort with pathologically proven diagnoses. **Interpretation**: Our findings indicate that in clinically normal individuals, APOE $\varepsilon 4$ status significantly predicts progression to MCI or AD across older adulthood and that this **risk varies with age**. This information will be useful as therapeutic interventions become available and clinical decisions can be individually tailored based on age and genetic data."
T45,A potential endophenotype for Alzheimer's disease: cerebrospinal fluid clusterin,"**Abstract**: Genome-wide association studies have associated **clusterin (CLU) variants** with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of CLU on AD pathogenesis is not totally understood. We used **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma CLU levels as endophenotypes** for genetic studies to understand the role of CLU in AD. **CSF, but not plasma, CLU levels were significantly associated with AD status** and CSF **tau/amyloid-beta ratio**, and highly correlated with CSF **apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels**. Several loci showed almost genome-wide significant associations including **LINC00917** ($p = 3.98 \times 10^{-7}$) and **interleukin 6 (IL6)** ($p = 9.94 \times 10^{-6}$, in the entire data set and in the APOE $\varepsilon 4-$ individuals $p = 7.40 \times 10^{-8}$). Gene ontology analyses suggest that CSF CLU levels may be associated with **wound healing and immune response** which supports previous functional studies that demonstrated an association between CLU and IL6. **CLU** may play a role in AD by influencing **immune system changes** that have been observed in AD or by disrupting healing after neurodegeneration."
T46,Genome-wide association study of prolactin levels in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid,"**Background**: **Prolactin** is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that plays an essential role in lactation, tissue growth, and suppressing apoptosis to increase cell survival. Prolactin serves as a key player in many life-critical processes, including **immune system and reproduction**. Prolactin is also found in multiple fluids throughout the body, including **plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**. **Methods**: In this study, we measured prolactin levels in both plasma and CSF, and performed a genome-wide association study. We then performed meta-analyses using METAL with a significance threshold of $p < 5 \times 10^{-8}$ and removed SNPs where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets. **Results**: We identified **12 SNPs associated with increased prolactin levels in both biological fluids**. **Conclusions**: Our efforts will help researchers understand how prolactin is regulated in both CSF and plasma, which could be beneficial in research for the **immune system and reproduction**."
T47,Chitinase-3-like 1 protein (CHI3L1) locus influences cerebrospinal fluid levels of YKL-40,"**Background**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology appears several years before clinical symptoms, so identifying ways to detect individuals in the preclinical stage is imperative. The **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau/$A\beta_{42}$ ratio** is currently the best known predictor of AD status and cognitive decline, and the ratio of CSF levels of **chitinase-3-like 1 protein (CHI3L1, YKL-40)** and amyloid beta ($A\beta_{42}$) were reported as predictive, but individual variability and group overlap inhibits their utility for individual diagnosis making it necessary to find ways to improve sensitivity of these biomarkers. **Methods**: We used linear regression to identify genetic loci associated with **CSF YKL-40 levels** in 379 individuals (80 cognitively impaired and 299 cognitively normal) from the Charles F and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. We tested correlations between YKL-40 and CSF Tau/$A\beta_{42}$ ratio, $A\beta_{42}$, tau, and phosphorylated tau ($ptau_{181}$). We used studentized residuals from a linear regression model of the log-transformed, standardized protein levels and the additive reference allele counts from the most significant locus to adjust YKL-40 values and tested the differences in correlations with CSF Tau/$A\beta_{42}$ ratio, $A\beta_{42}$, tau, and $ptau_{181}$. **Results**: We found that genetic variants on the **CHI3L1 locus** were significantly associated with **CSF YKL-40 levels**, but not AD risk, age at onset, or disease progression. The most significant variant is a reported **expression quantitative trait locus for CHI3L1**, the gene which encodes **YKL-40**, and explained **12.74 % of the variance in CSF YKL-40** in our study. (The abstract appears to be cut off here.)"
T48,Shared genetic etiology of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular diseases,"**Abstract**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are both common disorders in the elderly, and **AD and CVDs share common risk factors**. To explore the shared genetic architecture between AD and 11 CVD-related traits (CVDs, blood pressure [BP], coronary artery disease [CAD], atrial fibrillation [AF], cholesterol levels [TC, LDL, HDL], triglycerides [TG], and diabetes-related traits [T2D, BMI]), we performed a **large-scale cross-trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis** using the summary statistics from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and the CardiogramplusC4D (CAD) and DIAGRAM (T2D) consortia. Significant **genetic correlations** were identified between AD and CAD ($r_g = 0.20$), TC ($r_g = -0.19$), LDL ($r_g = -0.22$), HDL ($r_g = 0.20$), and T2D ($r_g = -0.16$). By using the **conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method**, we identified 39 novel AD-associated loci conditional on CVD-related traits. Among them, **rs79524815** near **HDAC9** and **rs10984186** near **CDK5RAP2** were identified as **shared genetic loci** for AD and CAD. Enrichment analysis showed that the shared genes between AD and CAD were enriched in **cellular adhesion** and **mitophagy** pathways. Our findings support a **shared genetic architecture** between AD and CVDs and provide new insights into the pleiotropic genes that underlie AD and CVDs."
T49,Genetic and non-genetic factors associated with white matter hyperintensity burden in community-dwelling older adults,"**Abstract**: **White matter hyperintensities (WMH)**, visible on brain MRI, are a common finding in older individuals and an indicator of **cerebral small vessel disease (SVD)**. WMH are associated with cognitive decline, stroke, and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying etiology of WMH is complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of WMH volume in a cohort of 5396 community-dwelling older adults from the CHARGE consortium (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology). We meta-analyzed our WMH GWAS results with a large published meta-analysis (up to $N = 33,083$). We identified a **novel genome-wide significant locus** at **rs1420790** near the **TRIM59** gene ($P = 4.8 \times 10^{-8}$). We then performed multi-trait analyses of WMH with AD risk and stroke. WMH showed a **significant genetic correlation** with AD ($r_g = 0.23, P = 0.002$), **large artery stroke** ($r_g = 0.38, P = 0.007$), and **lacunar stroke** ($r_g = 0.40, P = 0.002$), but not cardioembolic stroke. Using a polygenic risk score (PRS), we found that the **AD PRS was associated with WMH volume** ($\beta = 0.06, P = 0.005$) and that the stroke PRS was also associated with WMH ($\beta = 0.07, P = 0.002$). Non-genetic risk factors, including **hypertension and smoking**, were also strongly associated with WMH volume. Our findings support the hypothesis that **WMH, AD, and stroke share a common genetic and vascular etiology**."
T50,Whole-genome sequencing reveals new rare coding variants in $CD33$ and $TREM2$ associated with Alzheimer's disease,"**Abstract**: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but they explain only a fraction of the heritability. We conducted a **whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study** in a case-control cohort (1764 AD cases and 1604 controls of European ancestry) to identify novel rare coding variants. We identified a novel **rare missense variant in $CD33$ (p.Arg34His, rs12458421)** associated with a decreased risk of AD ($\text{OR} = 0.58, P = 2.4 \times 10^{-4}$). This variant is also associated with **decreased CD33 expression** in monocytes. In addition, we identified a **novel rare variant in $TREM2$ (p.Val187Ile, rs145778233)** that is associated with an increased risk of AD ($\text{OR} = 1.94, P = 2.4 \times 10^{-3}$). Both **$CD33$ and $TREM2$ are highly expressed in microglia** and involved in the innate immune response, further supporting the role of inflammation in AD. Our findings expand the genetic landscape of AD by highlighting novel rare coding variants in known AD genes, emphasizing the power of WGS for rare variant discovery."
T51,Investigation of the role of APOE in the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease,"**Abstract**: **APOE** $\varepsilon 4$ is the strongest common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), while variants in the **GBA** gene and the **LRRK2** gene are important genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationship between AD and PD is complex, with some shared clinical and pathological features. We used large GWAS datasets of AD and PD (IGAP and the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium) to assess the shared genetic architecture, with a specific focus on the APOE region. We performed **LD-score regression** and **conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) analyses**. We observed a **significant negative genetic correlation** between AD and PD ($r_g = -0.19, P = 0.004$). Specifically focusing on the APOE region, we found that the APOE $\varepsilon 4$ allele was significantly associated with **decreased risk for PD** in the total sample ($\text{OR} = 0.92, P = 1.2 \times 10^{-4}$). The cFDR analysis identified **49 loci** associated with AD conditional on PD, and **31 loci** associated with PD conditional on AD. Among the pleiotropic genes identified, **APOE** and **SNCA** showed a strong association with both AD and PD. Our results suggest a **shared and partially inverse genetic architecture** between AD and PD, and confirm the **protective effect of APOE $\varepsilon 4$ on PD risk**. This highlights the complexity of genetic overlap in neurodegenerative diseases."
T52,Novel loci for Alzheimer's disease defined by a genome-wide association study of neuropathological features,"**Abstract**: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) have identified numerous risk loci, but the genetic architecture underlying the specific neuropathological hallmarks of AD (neuritic plaques [NP] and neurofibrillary tangles [NFT]) is less clear. We performed a large-scale GWAS of **autopsy-confirmed neuropathological features** (NP, NFT, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA]) using data from 13,382 subjects from the International Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). We identified **two novel genome-wide significant loci** for **NFT burden**: **rs2019904** near **GLT8D2** ($P = 2.4 \times 10^{-8}$) and **rs7727376** near **CLU** ($P = 3.6 \times 10^{-8}$). The latter also showed an association with NP burden ($P = 8.1 \times 10^{-7}$). We also confirmed the known association between NP and the **APOE** region. An intergenic SNP **rs11014166** on chromosome 16 was associated with **CAA** burden ($P = 4.9 \times 10^{-8}$). Pathway analysis of the identified genes revealed enrichment in **synaptic signaling**, **immune response**, and **lipid metabolism**. These findings reveal novel genetic loci that specifically influence the accumulation of AD neuropathology, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of $\text{NFT}$ and $\text{NP}$ formation independent of clinical diagnosis."
T53,Genetic variants in TOMM40 modify the effect of APOE on the age of Alzheimer's disease onset,"**Abstract**: The **APOE** gene is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but the age of onset (AOO) is highly variable. A common variant, **rs10524523**, in the adjacent **TOMM40** gene has been associated with LOAD AOO. We examined the interaction between APOE and TOMM40 on AOO in 5,699 LOAD cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). We used a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by APOE $\varepsilon 4$ dosage. We found that the **TOMM40 poly-T length variant** (**rs10524523**) significantly modified the effect of APOE $\varepsilon 4$ on AOO in the **APOE $\varepsilon 3/\varepsilon 3$ and $\varepsilon 3/\varepsilon 4$ genotypes**. Specifically, in $\varepsilon 3/\varepsilon 3$ individuals, the short poly-T allele was associated with a **later AOO** ($\text{HR} = 0.78, P = 0.003$). In $\varepsilon 3/\varepsilon 4$ individuals, the short poly-T allele was associated with a **later AOO** ($\text{HR} = 0.82, P = 0.01$). In $\varepsilon 4/\varepsilon 4$ individuals, there was no significant effect. Our results confirm that TOMM40 variants, specifically the poly-T length, **modify the risk profile conferred by APOE** and contribute to the heterogeneity of AD AOO. This suggests that the combined effects of variants in the APOE-TOMM40 locus are crucial for determining individual AD risk and disease timing."
T54,GWAS identifies a novel locus in SHARPIN associated with white matter hyperintensity volume,"**Abstract**: **White matter hyperintensities (WMH)**, visible on MRI, are markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and are associated with stroke and cognitive decline. The genetic factors influencing WMH are not fully understood. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of WMH volume in 43,445 participants of European descent from 29 cohorts of the CHARGE consortium. We identified **four genome-wide significant loci** associated with WMH volume. Three loci were previously identified (**PMF1/CBS, TRIM68, and a locus on chromosome 17q25**). The fourth locus is **novel**: **rs9468383** near **SHARPIN** on chromosome 8 ($P = 4.8 \times 10^{-8}$). Pathway enrichment analysis implicated pathways related to **neurodegeneration** and **vascular disease**. We also performed a genetic correlation analysis which showed a significant genetic overlap between WMH and stroke, cognitive function, and Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the shared genetic mechanisms between WMH and other neurovascular traits and identify **SHARPIN** as a novel candidate gene for cerebral SVD, potentially through its role in **inflammation** and **apoptosis**."
T55,Genetic analysis of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease identifies **PTK2B** and **NBEAL1** as novel susceptibility loci,"**Abstract**: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) have implicated numerous loci, but studies using **autopsy-confirmed AD** cases and controls may provide a more robust identification of AD susceptibility genes by reducing diagnostic error. We conducted a large GWAS of autopsy-confirmed AD cases and controls (12,713 individuals) from the International Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). We confirmed all previously established AD loci and identified **two novel genome-wide significant loci**: **rs11883395** near **PTK2B** ($P = 3.6 \times 10^{-8}$) and **rs2071190** near **NBEAL1** ($P = 4.1 \times 10^{-8}$). **PTK2B** is an enzyme involved in **synaptic signaling and neuronal plasticity**, and its expression is increased in AD brains. **NBEAL1** is involved in the regulation of the **endosome/lysosome system**, a process increasingly linked to AD pathogenesis. We also confirmed the strong association with the **APOE** region. Pathway analysis of the combined list of AD genes confirmed enrichment in pathways related to **lipid metabolism, endocytosis, and immune response**. Our results demonstrate the utility of using neuropathologically defined cohorts and highlight new genes involved in synaptic function and lysosomal pathways that contribute to AD susceptibility."
T56,Genome-wide association study of blood and cerebrospinal fluid total tau levels in a multi-cohort study,"**Abstract**: **Total tau (t-tau)** protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are a key biomarker for neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood t-tau levels, while less commonly used, are emerging as a potential non-invasive biomarker. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of **CSF t-tau** and **blood t-tau** levels in a multi-cohort study ($N$ up to 10,000 for CSF and $N$ up to 20,000 for blood). For **CSF t-tau**, we confirmed the established association near **MAPT** (best SNP **rs11136000**, $P = 1.2 \times 10^{-19}$) and identified a **novel genome-wide significant locus** at **rs76854344** near **CNTNAP5** ($P = 2.4 \times 10^{-8}$). **CNTNAP5** is a neuronal adhesion molecule involved in synaptic processes. For **blood t-tau**, we confirmed associations near **MAPT** and identified a **novel locus** near **VMP1** ($P = 3.8 \times 10^{-8}$). Interestingly, the genetic architecture of blood t-tau and CSF t-tau only showed a **moderate genetic correlation** ($r_g = 0.35, P = 0.001$), suggesting that different mechanisms regulate tau protein levels in these two compartments. This study provides new insights into the genetic regulation of tau biomarkers and highlights the unique factors influencing tau levels in the brain versus the periphery."
T57,Genetic variants in $APOE/TOMM40$ and **$BCHE$** are associated with multiple brain imaging and cognitive phenotypes in a multi-ethnic cohort,"**Abstract**: The **APOE** gene is the strongest genetic factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been associated with various brain imaging and cognitive traits, often referred to as endophenotypes. We performed a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based association study (GBAS) of multiple **brain imaging and cognitive phenotypes** (e.g., hippocampal volume, cognitive scores, functional connectivity) in a multi-ethnic cohort (European, African American, and Hispanic individuals). We confirmed the robust association of variants in the **APOE/TOMM40** locus with multiple phenotypes, including hippocampal volume and memory performance. Furthermore, we identified significant associations between variants in the **BCHE** (Butyrylcholinesterase) gene and both hippocampal volume and executive function in the total sample ($P_{\text{GBAS}} < 1 \times 10^{-4}$). The association of **BCHE** with hippocampal volume was particularly strong in the African American sub-cohort. **BCHE** is a cholinesterase inhibitor target and has been previously implicated in AD and cognitive function. Our multi-ethnic approach validates the central role of the APOE/TOMM40 locus in AD endophenotypes and suggests that the **BCHE** gene is a promising candidate for further investigation, especially in diverse populations."
T58,Genome-wide association study of $\text{A}\beta_{42}/\text{A}\beta_{40}$ ratio in Alzheimer's disease,"**Abstract**: The ratio of **amyloid- $\beta$ $42$ to $40$ ($A\beta_{42}/A\beta_{40}$)** in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a superior biomarker for cerebral amyloidosis compared to $A\beta_{42}$ alone and is increasingly used in clinical trials and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the CSF $A\beta_{42}/A\beta_{40}$ ratio in a multi-cohort study ($N = 2,058$). We identified a **novel genome-wide significant locus** at **rs78564171** near the **TMEM106B** gene ($P = 4.3 \times 10^{-8}$). **TMEM106B** is a known risk locus for **frontotemporal dementia (FTD)** and has been associated with lysosomal function. We also confirmed the well-established association with the **APOE** region. Pathway analysis suggested enrichment in pathways related to **lysosomal function** and **autophagy**. Our results confirm the strong genetic influence on the CSF A$\beta$ ratio and identify **TMEM106B** as a novel genetic factor influencing the A$\beta$ clearance pathway, suggesting a shared mechanism between AD and FTD pathology related to lysosomal dysfunction."
